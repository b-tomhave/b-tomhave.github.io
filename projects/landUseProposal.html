<p>
    As a member of a three-person team, I helped to develop a land use proposal for a Shared Use Mobility Hub using Adobe InDesign software.
    This report syntesized demographic information, land use, built form zoning codes, and similar case studies to present a Mobility Hub proposal
    tailored to the project intersection context.
