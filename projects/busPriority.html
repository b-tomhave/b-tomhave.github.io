        The first step in this project was to identify the rideshed for each park &amp; ride lot. We had just completed a park &amp;
        ride survey completed in mid-2018. I utilized a 
        <a href="http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/" target = "_blank">free geocoder</a> 
        from Texas A&amp;M University and I plotted the home location of PART's passengers by which park &amp; ride facility they
        parked their car. The results were circular shapes around urban park &amp; ride facilities while more rural lots were fan
        shaped. What we learned from this is that because urban lots are more central, they attract passengers from a wider area
        while the rural lots primarily had passengers coming from upstream. In the survery results, there were very few examples
        of passengers traveling from downstream to access a park &amp; lot.

        The next step was to analyze the demographic data for the rideshed. For this, I noted variables of interest from the
        2014-2018 5-year estimates of the American Community Survey. Using the 
        <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html" target="_blank">Census API</a>
        and a Jupyter Notebook, I requested the individual variables and transformed the data. I brought the Census data into
        ArcGIS Pro for geoprocessing where I developed a short
        <a href="https://github.com/miguelf88/system_analysis" target="_blank">Python script</a>.
        I then created a web map and dashboard to display the demographpic data. This dashboard is used when PART staff
        are writing grant applications and they need demographic figures for the entire PART system or an individual route.

        When route planning, it is important to look at origin-destination data so the planner knows where people are coming from
        and going. <a href="https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/" target = "_blank">OnTheMap</a> is a great tool to use and download
        OD data from. Each rideshed polygon was analyzed in OnTheMap and the results were exported and loaded into ArcGIS Pro. I
        created two dashboards that are located on the LEHD Jobs tabs in the Story Map.
