    Metro Transit is currently expanding and improving their bus network. As a part of this expansion, new arterial bus rapid transit (BRT) lines
    will be created across the region. During this process, Metro Transit sought public input to help identify the next three BRT lines from list of 10 candidate corridors. As part of this public engagement effort, Metro Transit planned to post informational leaflets/decals in 100 transit shelters across the region. 
    With a service area of over 900 square miles and over 1,000 transit shelters, the challenge was to <b>systematically determine 100 transit shelters that would
    have the most even distribution across both the region and the 10 candidate corridors while simultaneously reaching the greatest number of transit riders. </b>

    Using a programming script I wrote in R, I filtered the dataset of all possible shelters to only include shelters within the proposed BRT corridors. To this database, I then joined the ridership data associated with each shelter. After assembling the necessary data, shelters were assigned two ranks based on ridership, one for the 
    overall ridership rank across all valid shelters and a second for only the shelters along the particular candidate corridor. Using the combination of these two rankings, the top 100 shelters were selected. Then, to ensure that each corridor had an even number of selected shelters proportional to corridor length, 
    the shelters with the lowest overall ranking were replaced with the next highest ranking shelter on an underrepresented corridor until each corridor had a proportionate amount of selected shelters.
