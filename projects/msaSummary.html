<p>
   As part of my Urban Planning Master's program, I created a short memo/report analyzing the density gradient of the Boston MSA for both 2000 and 2010.
   This included downloading and manipulating census data, estimating the urban density gradient using regression analysis, and mapping density (by census tract)
    for the metropolitan area. This report culminated in a summary synthesis of the Greater Boston area settlement pattern.
