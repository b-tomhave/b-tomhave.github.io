<p>As an Urban Planning and Civil Engineering (Transportation) dual-degree masterâ€™s student, I bring a well-rounded background to every project and problem that I face.
  I am well versed in leading projects, performing outreach and engagement, collecting and analyzing complex transit data and, perhaps most importantly, being able to communicate and visualize the results of these activities in a manner that is broadly accessible to experts as well as members of the community.
  I believe that I would make an excellent contribution to a company seeking an employee that blends the lines between raw analytics and the ability to relate to individuals from a wide range of backgrounds.</p>
